"This is machine and language independent benchmark test designed for the comparison of System Implementation Languages and their implementations on various machines by various compilers."

Original readme:

A Benchmark Test for Systems Implementation Languages
-----------------------------------------------------

This distribution is currently being put together and will be in a
more polished state in due course.

The file bench.tgz contains a benchmark program translated into
various languages. It was designed in 1980 to test the efficiency of
implementations of programming languages.  There is also a ZIP version
of the distribution in bench.zip.

The files and directories in bench.tgz can be extracted (under Linux
or Cygwin) by a command such as the following:

      tar zxvf bench.tgz

This will create a unix makefile and the directory src containing
directories for the different programming languages into which the
benchmark program has been translated.

There is some documentation in src/doc.  This README file is in
src/doc/README. A description of the benchmark test itself in
src/doc/info and some test results are in src/doc/results.

Please feel free to re-implement this benchmark in any language you
choose.  I would be happy to incorporate such tranlations into this
distribution together with their timing/size results.
